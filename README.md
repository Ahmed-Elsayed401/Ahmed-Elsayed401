##  About Me  

I am a third-year Cybersecurity student focused on **Security Operations (SOC)** and defensive security practices.

I specialize in **security monitoring, log analysis, alert investigation, and incident response fundamentals**.  
Through hands-on lab environments, I continuously develop practical skills in detecting suspicious behavior, validating alerts, and following structured investigation workflows.

I am highly detail-oriented, analytical, and committed to building a strong foundation in real-world SOC operations.
