##  About Me  

I am a third-year Cybersecurity student focused on **Security Operations (SOC)** and defensive security practices.

I specialize in **security monitoring, log analysis, alert investigation, and incident response fundamentals**.  
Through hands-on lab environments, I continuously develop practical skills in detecting suspicious behavior, validating alerts, and following structured investigation workflows.

I am highly detail-oriented, analytical, and committed to building a strong foundation in real-world SOC operations.

##  Core Competencies  

- SIEM Monitoring & Log Ingestion  
- Windows Security Event Log Analysis  
- Authentication & Brute-Force Detection  
- Alert Validation & False Positive Analysis  
- Event Correlation & Investigation Workflow  
- Incident Triage & Documentation  

---

##  Practical SOC Experience  

🔹 Designed and deployed a **SOC Lab using Wazuh SIEM**  
🔹 Integrated Windows 10 endpoint with centralized log monitoring  
🔹 Analyzed authentication-related Event Logs  
🔹 Generated security alerts based on failed login attempts (brute-force behavior)  
🔹 Performed alert validation and structured investigation  
🔹 Documented findings following Detection → Analysis → Documentation methodology

##  SOC Home Lab – Wazuh SIEM

As part of my SOC training, I built a home lab using Kali Linux as the Wazuh SIEM server and Windows 10 as the monitored endpoint.
After configuring the Wazuh manager and deploying the agent on Windows, I validated log ingestion and began monitoring Windows Security Event Logs, focusing on authentication-related events such as Event ID 4625 (failed logon attempts).
To test detection capabilities, I simulated brute-force login attempts on the Windows machine. The generated events were successfully collected and correlated by Wazuh, which triggered security alerts visible on the dashboard.
I then performed structured alert validation and investigation, reviewing event details, login patterns, and source activity while documenting findings according to SOC workflow practices (Detection → Analysis → Documentation).
This lab strengthened my practical skills in SIEM deployment, log analysis, authentication monitoring, and basic incident response procedures within a controlled SOC environment.
